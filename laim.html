      <p>A logical and semantic information model that describes the core entities, relationships and events for livestock.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Defining a semantic information model with concrete syntax based on international standards will improve the quality and timeliness of data exchange in agriculture. These improvements in inter-system communication leads to lower costs of integration, solutions of higher accuracy and the opportunity to create more value for farmers and industry partners.</p>
      <aside class="note" title="background">
        <p>Other industries have benefited from this approach and this initiative is an attempt to bring these concepts to agriculture.</p>

      <h2>Guide to the specification</h2>
      <p>
          This specification is uses a common approach to modelling and representing different aspects of livestock agriculture. The specification is divided into the following sections, Animal Sale & Purchase, Animal Feeding, Animal Health, Animal Reproduction, Animal Slaughter, Animal Milking Events. Each of these sections defines a set of events related to the specific aspect of livestock agriculture. These events utilise core entities that are defined in the Core Entities section. Each section defines the event as a logical information model, with text and diagrams, and then provides the RDF and SHACL representation of the event. Controlled vocabularies are used to define some of the values of the properties belonging to entities and events. These are also defined in a common section called vocabulary.
